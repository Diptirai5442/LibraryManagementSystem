Here's the step-by-step working of the Library Management System:

Project Structure:

Controllers handle HTTP requests
Services contain business logic
Repositories manage database operations
Entities define data models
Security configurations protect endpoints


User Registration Flow:

User submits registration details
System encrypts password
User data stored in H2 database
JWT token generated for authentication


Authentication Process:

User logs in with credentials
System validates credentials
JWT token issued for subsequent requests
Token required for protected endpoints


Book Management:

CRUD operations for books
Role-based access control
Librarians can add/update books
Users can view and search books
Admins have full access


Security Features:

JWT based authentication
Password encryption
Role-based authorization
Protected API endpoints
Stateless session management


Database:

H2 in-memory database
JPA/Hibernate for ORM
Entity relationships
Data persistence


API Endpoints:

/api/auth/* for authentication
/api/books/* for book operations
/register for user registration
Protected routes need JWT token
The system follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns and industry-standard security practices!
